.About this guide

This guide is meant to help document how absc -- the ABS compiler -- works, as
well as to help new contributors get involved in development, and for using
ABS as basis for their own research.  It is meant as a high-level overview,
presenting the kinds of things that (ideally) do not change frequently.

Part 1 contains general information that should be useful no matter how you
are contributing.  Part 2 contains information about how various parts of the
compiler work.

This guide is currently a work-in-progress.  Contributions and corrections to
this guide are very welcome!
